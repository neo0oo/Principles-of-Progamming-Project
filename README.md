# Principles-of-Progamming-Project
**How the game works**
- You always have 3 items in your inventory
- Each room either requires items to use or has a puzzle type of thing
- In the starting room outside of the cave you see a cryptic message inscribed in stone - This has a hint for each room to pass without taking damage
- You have an inventoy which always has 3 items, with (each or some) rooms you are offered item(s) that you can replace your items for. **Each room must always be passible no matter what items you have**
- The last room has a boss fight (idk what the way to beat it is yet) - you will always take initial damage at the start of the fight so you have to pass through the other rooms without taking too much damage
- When you die you start from the very start of the game - the point of the game is to repeat it multiple times and learn the ways to pass each room before you can complete the game fully

Start:
  1. Small introduction (character)
  2. Small introduction (situation) - Cave of fortunes has a mysterious item
  3. Days of journeying through the forest
  4. Finally stumbles upon the cave of fortune
  5. At the door there is a message etched into the stone (each line is the clue for each room to pass without damage)
  6. Will you enter? --> Enters
  7. Inventory: rope, torch, knife

Room 1: 
  1. Room with beam at the top and chasm
  2. Option 1: **Rope** Swing across the beam --> lose a bit of health 
  3. Option 2: **Knife no torch** "you swing at nothing..." --> nothing happens
  4. Option 3: **Torch** You light up the room and see a lose bit in the wall
  5. Option 4: **Knife after torch** Pry open the lose bit in the wall --> Secret path opens --> pass the room with no damage taken
  6. At the end offered 2 items - gas mask (useful for room 3), pickaxe (useless)

if player loses in this round he restarts back to the beginning of the room he is in

Room 2:
  1. Room with the option on going over two platforms.
  2. One of the platform is the correct one that makes you take a step without taking any damage.
  3. The other includes a pressure plate that would make you take a shot of a poisonous dart which takes off 10 health.
  4. The player is going to have to pick between the options left or right 3 times.
  5. There would be no secret passage or another way out of this room this is the only way.
  6. The pattern would be right left right.
  7. There would be a clue that would show this such as "In football there is a term called 1 2"

if player loses in this round he restarts back to the beginning of the room he is in

Room 3:
  1. Room including  alot of rocks covering the path to room 4 and poisonous gas where player is going to take damage.
  2. Option 1: Use torch --> Light up the whole room - instant death
  3. Option 2: Use rope --> Instant death since it would benefit with nothing
  4. Option 3 : Use knife--> To destroy the machine that projects this gas and take 10 damage then remove all the rocks blocking the path
  5. Option 4 : Use picked up Pickaxe (from room 1) --> To destroy the machine that projects this gas and take 10 damage then remove all the rocks blocking the path 
  6. Option 5: Use picked up Gas Mask (from room 1) --> Takes no damage and is able to find his way out through having the time to remove all the rocks in front of the path
  7. Player would have the option on picking up Heavy machine gun or Speed shoes or Angelic wings

if player loses in this round he restarts back to the beginning of the room he is in

Room 4:
  1. Room filled with a swarm of posessed human skeletons with low vision that have lost their lifes during their adventure.
  2. Option 1: Use Knife --> Manages to take out all skeletons but skeletons have regeneration so player takes 10 damage but does not die or manage to escape so he has the choice of repicking an item.
  3. Option 2: Use Machine Gun --> Manages to take out all skeletons but skeletons have regeneration so player takes 10 damage but does not die or manage to escape so he has the choice of repicking an item.
  4. Option 3: Use Speed shoes --> Out run skeletons to the other side and manage to escape to the final room without taking any damage.
  5. Option 4: Use Wings -->  (Length from floor to ceiling is too low for you to use your wings.
  6. Option 5: Use Torch --> Instant death (Torch brings light to the room which makes Skeletons be able to see you more.)
  7. Option 6: Use Rope --> Instant death (Useless item for the battle since there is too many skeletons).
  8. Option 7: Use Pickaxe --> Manages to take out all skeletons but skeletons have regeneration so player takes 10 damage but does not die or manage to escape so he has the choice of repicking an item.

If player picked the machine gun and loses in this room. He must restart at the previous room to rehave the choice of picking up the correct item.
But if player had picked up the speed shoes or the angelic wings. He restarts in the same room.

Final room:
  1. Gold, jewls, etc... littered across the floor
  2. Accidentally press pressure plate
  3. Barrier comes up, blocking treasure... guardian comes down
  4. Fight guardian
  5. Defeat guardian
  6. Access gold with the key obtained by guardian
  7. You go to the mysterious item in the middle and once you take it the cave starts collapsing
  8. Run out of the cave and survive
  9. The end
